    The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability 
    of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the 
    same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an 
    employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called 
    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.

    In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

        Compile time Polymorphism
        Runtime Polymorphism

    Compile time polymorphism:
        This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

        Function Overloading: 
            When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are 
            said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change 
            in type of arguments

        Operator Overloading:
            C++ also provide option to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for 
            string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is 
            to add two operands. So a single operator ‘+’ when placed between integer operands , adds them and 
            when placed between string operands, concatenates them.

    Runtime polymorphism:
        This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.

        Function overriding on the other hand occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the 
        member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
