In C++, we can make operators to work for user defined classes. This means C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading.
For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +.
Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Number, Fractional Number, Big Integer, etc.
