DEFINATION:

2. Multiple Inheritance: Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes. i.e one sub class is inherited from more than one base classes.

SYNTAX:

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class1, access_mode base_class2, ....
{
  //body of subclass
};

C++ CODE:
// C++ program to explain
// multiple inheritance
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// first base class
class Vehicle {
public:
	Vehicle()
	{
	cout << "This is a Vehicle" << endl;
	}
};

// second base class
class FourWheeler {
public:
	FourWheeler()
	{
	cout << "This is a 4 wheeler Vehicle" << endl;
	}
};

// sub class derived from two base classes
class Car: public Vehicle, public FourWheeler {

};

// main function
int main()
{
	// creating object of sub class will
	// invoke the constructor of base classes
	Car obj;
	return 0;
}
