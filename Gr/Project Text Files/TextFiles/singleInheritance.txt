
Defination:

Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one sub class is inherited by one base class only.

Syntax: 

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class
{
  //body of subclass
};

C++ Code:
// C++ program to explain
// Single inheritance
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// base class
class Vehicle {
public:
	Vehicle()
	{
	cout << "This is a Vehicle" << endl;
	}
};

// sub class derived from a single base classes
class Car: public Vehicle{

};

// main function
int main()
{
	// creating object of sub class will
	// invoke the constructor of base classes
	Car obj;
	return 0;
}


Output
This is a Vehicle
